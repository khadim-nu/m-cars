                    As you may notice on our site, some of the cars available for sale are listed as “Category D”. There is a large amount of discussion about these type of used vehicles and for good reason. It’s important to be aware that all of the Category D cars available for sale by M-cars come with full service history, meaning you can be secure in the knowledge that you are able to consult any car’s accident/ownership history, as well as being able to present this to any insurers for proof. 
                </p>
                <p>

                    If you are unsure of what ‘Category D’ means, here are the facts:
                </p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Category D means the car has been involved in an incident deemed by insurance firms to cost less to repair than 50% of the present value of the firm
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Despite this, the overall cost of repair i.e including costs such as a courtesy car for the customer, administration costs etc. are determined not to be economically viable for the insurer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Instead, the customer is given a cash sum and the car is then sold for salvage, whereby it may be fully repaired and returned to the road. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Category D is no indication of the level of damage administered to the vehicle, instead simply meaning that the above process has occurred and that this label legally must be applied by a dealer to the car. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For this reason, car’s described as ‘written-off’ Category D merely means they were not cost-effective for an insurer to repair, and may have in fact only incurred minor damage. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always consult the provided service history for full information on any incidents a Category D, or any used car has been involved in.
