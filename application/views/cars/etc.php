            <p><strong>What is Buy, sell, source?</strong></p>
            <p>After many years of experience in the used car market, M-cars distinguished 3 core services attributed as most sought after by our customer base. 
                These include: </p>
            <p>1. The ability to buy a used car with the same clarity, information and peace of mind as a large dealership without the huge mark-up.</p>
            <p>2. The option to sell unwanted cars at a fair price as either a part exchange or for lump sum.</p>
            <p>3. Lastly, the more tailored service of sourcing the right car specific to an individual’s needs, for any given price-range. </p>
            <p><strong>Category cars</strong></p>
            <p>As you may notice on our site, some of the cars available for sale are listed as “Category D”. There is a large amount of discussion about these type of used vehicles and for good reason. It’s important to be aware that all of the Category D cars available for sale by M-cars come with full service history, meaning you can be secure in the knowledge that you are able to consult any car’s accident/ownership history, as well as being able to present this to any insurers for proof. </p>
            <p>If you are unsure of what ‘Category D’ means, here are the facts:</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Category D means the car has been involved in an incident deemed by insurance firms to cost less to repair than 50% of the present value of the firm.</li>
                <li>Despite this, the overall cost of repair i.e including costs such as a courtesy car for the customer, administration costs etc. are determined not to be economically viable for the insurer</li>
                <li>Instead, the customer is given a cash sum and the car is then sold for salvage, whereby it may be fully repaired and returned to the road.</li>
                <li>Category D is no indication of the level of damage administered to the vehicle, instead simply meaning that the above process has occurred and that this label legally must be applied by a dealer to the car. </li>
                <li>For this reason, car’s described as ‘written-off’ Category D merely means they were not cost-effective for an insurer to repair, and may have in fact only incurred minor damage. </li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>Always consult the provided service history for full information on any incidents a Category D, or any used car has been involved in. </p>
